Codename for a project where I'll have to make a small event-driven pipeline (MQTT -> NATS -> function) with OpenTelemetry spans throughout. Additionally merging some other areas I'm equally interested in exploring.

todo: write better documentation
- probably will try to make this with helmfile at some point by curiosity
