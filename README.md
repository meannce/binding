Codename for a project where I'll have to make a small event-driven pipeline (MQTT -> NATS -> function) with OpenTelemetry spans throughout. Additionally merging some other areas I'm equally interested in exploring.

to-do: write better documentation
1. `cd k8s && helm install nats nats/nats -f nats-deployment`
